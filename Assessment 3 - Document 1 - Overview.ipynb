    "The proliferation of cloud technologies and big data means that companies and invididuals have more data than every to process and understand. Fortunatly the compute power and cheap storage (among other things) hav  become more ubiqutious and almost all companies and indiviuals are connected to the internet.  \n",

    "One of the changes as a result of this is the movement of stock exchanges (and traders) away from traditional trading to the utilisation of \"Automated Trading Systems\". According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/automated-trading-systems.asp) these are *\"Automated trading systems — also referred to as mechanical trading systems, algorithmic trading, automated trading or system trading — allow traders to establish specific rules for both trade entries and exits that, once programmed, can be automatically executed via a computer. \"*. Furthermore, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/automated-trading-systems.asp) 70% to 80% or more of all shared in the US are traded through automated trading systems. \n",

    "Garcia et. al. (Garcia, 2012) found in their paper *\"Information processing in the stock market around anticipated accounting information: Earnings release\"* that share prices are significanlty impacted by earnings releases and other information published about companies.\n",

    "The issue is that share tradings need to process large volumes of information, mostly in text format, in order to determine what trading action to take based on the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This issue does not only affect share traders: in recent years sports betting has become very similar ot share trading in that a lot of betting decisions are made by automated systems. Sport betting have a similar issue to share trading in that large volumes of largely text data need to be processed to make betting decisions. Companies like [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/automated-betting-station/) have created API's for their marketplace to enable automated betting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is can be signifant improved through the use of Natual Language processing. Natural Language Processing can be used to process large corpus of text that contain potentially price sensitive information in them. Natural Language Processing can then be extend to extract relevant entities (like companies or sports team) and determine a sentiment score for each document. Finally, this can be supplmented with metadata about companies or sports teams from their websites, or third parties (like stock exchanges). All of this can be a compnent of an automated trading system that makes buying or selling decisions and executes the. \n",
